This is a starter kit designed to work just alongside a fresh or old Laravel 5.3 application.
- All routes have `unstarter` prefix to avoid conflicts with your development work.

There are only few convergence points which interfere with the app. These points are 

- A route file registered in your `app\Providers\RouteServiceProvider.php`. The file is provided in the `unrulynatives/helpers` package, you need to publish it (see the package's readme.md).

- Package service providers and facadae declared in your `config/app.php`. THe packages are registered out-of-the-box. Don't want a package? Just comment out the service provider and delete the package from `composer.json`.

- Traits declared in the `app/User.php` model. Among them `use Unrulynatives\Helpers\UserExtensions;`.

- some of the dependencies, such as `"Amranidev/scaffold-interface` have their own routes defined not in routes file, but in the package itself (`users`, `admin` in case of this one). 
One way of dealing with such conflicts is to move `App\Providers\RouteServiceProvider::class,` to position below the package service provide declaration.

# What it is
1. This is an instance of Laravel PHP Framework 5.3. A starter app. Its philosophy is slightly different than similar starter kits. Here are the highlights:

- All changes made over the original Laravel App have COMMENTS FOR BEGINNERS. You can delete them if you consider them not necessary. 

- Some solutions have variants, so that everyone one can pick the variant which suits their needs of the moment.

- I have installed theme system (igaster/laravel-theme) to provide solutions for different CSS frameworks. You can switch between them at will:

3. I am an amateur programmer, not a pro. I treat this starter app and a standalone package with helpers as a self-teaching tutorial. These two packages were originally my private repository of snippets, solutions, answers from StackOverflow and ideas which I needed to develop my proejcts. They contain all code which might come useful.

### for the original Laravel Framework go to [Laravel Repository](https://github.com/laravel/laravel)




# FEATURES

A complete, DB-fed list of implemented and future features is avalable at the [DEMO site](http://dev.unrulynatives.com). Most of the features are developed by preconfigured 3rd aprty packages.

    - A script to set hash value when switching between tabs on a page (`js/minitool_tabhas_bootstrap.js`).

    - 3 frontend solutions to show/reveal more content. (`js/minitool_showhide.js`). Example: an attribite `data-more-close` hides an element by use of jQuery `slideUp` at the page load.

    - A solution to load content into a modal. Content can be cloned from hidden DOM elements of loaded by AJAX (`js/minitool_modal_universal.js`).

## Other, less vital packages & features

# INSTALLATION

## Variant 1: Merging into your existing project

Note: all files and changes made to the original Laravel 5.3 laravel app are made in a way allowing you to get rid of some or all functions. 

    - All view files are stored in `starter` folder with exception of
    - `auth` folder which is created by the native Laravel command `php artisan make:auth`

    - all routes for the Starter functions are placed in `routes/starter.app`. You can comment out the routes in bulk or undegister the route file in `app/Providers/RouteServiceProvider.php`

    - Controllers for the Starter App are stored in subfloder `app/Http/Controllers/Starter`

## Variant 2: Setting up a new app

1. Pull this starter kit to your local drive

2. run `composer install`. You need to install the Composer itself to do that. See [Composer Download Page](https://getcomposer.org/download/).

3. Generate application key with shell command `artisan key:generate`

4. clone the file `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`

5. Create and populate the database. Make sure that 
- you would place the DB credentials to the `.env` file 
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql // this is the default mysql database connection. You can define extra connections later.
    DB_DATABASE=homestead
    DB_USERNAME=homestead
    DB_PASSWORD=secret

- in your `config/database.php` you would make the `mysql` connection refer to your `.env` file.

6. Initiate the Laravel's bundled authentication functions. As described here
use `php artisan make:auth` commmand. 

You will also need to create tables in your database. Use `php artisan migrate` to do that.


### LAST STEP
After completing the above steps the app should work. 
Point your browser to the `localhost/APP_FOLDER/public/`.. You should see the landing page. (This solution required DB connection to work properly)
Point your browser to the `localhost/APP_FOLDER/public/welcome`.. You should see the landing page. (You will see the standard welcome screen delivered by Laravel)


## integrating this package with bare Laravel app

This starter is designed to work alongside the bare Laravel app with as few modifications to the "blank" app as possible. The reason is simple: ssometimes new versions of the Laravel come with changes to the app structure.

The majority of the files are copied by the `unrulynatives/helpers` package: as soon as you publish the package assets, all necessary foles would appear in your app: 

- Copy middlewares from `app/Http/Middleware` and register them in the `\app\Http\Kernel.php` field.

- Copy `app/Helpers` and `app\Models`.

- Copy `\config\project_specific.php` file to target app's `config\` folder.

### Integrating:

- register the middlewares you have copied. Open your `app\Http\Kernel.php` and add 

```
        'admins' => \App\Http\Middleware\AllowAdmins::class,
        'moderators' => \App\Http\Middleware\AllowModerators::class,
        'developers' => \App\Http\Middleware\AllowDevelopers::class,
```        
to the `protected $routeMiddleware`.


- add your morph class definitions in `app\Providers\AppServiceProvider.php`. Use the instructions in https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/upgrade


### Optional steps. The newest changes to MySQL 5.7 produce some annoying problems with the app. This is how to avoid them. Modify the DB connection definition with this:

```
        'mysql' => [
            'driver' => 'mysql',
            'host' => env('DB_HOST', 'localhost'),
            'port' => env('DB_PORT', '3306'),
            'database' => env('DB_DATABASE', 'forge'),
            'username' => env('DB_USERNAME', 'forge'),
            'password' => env('DB_PASSWORD', ''),
            'charset' => 'utf8',
            'collation' => 'utf8_unicode_ci',
            'prefix' => '',

            // 'strict' => true,
            // 'engine' => null,
            // https://github.com/laravel/framework/issues/14908
            'strict' => true,
            'engine' => null,
            'modes' => [
            //'ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY',
            'STRICT_TRANS_TABLES',
            'NO_ZERO_IN_DATE',
            'NO_ZERO_DATE',
            'ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO',
            'NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER',
            'NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION'],
        ],
```

## Contribution guide

Just fork the project, adjust code or provide yours and do a pull request. 


## About this starter package

I am an amateur programmer, trying to create an sophisticated app for decisionmaking. The project is already launched in Poland in 2011. Now the code & content is adjusted to other languages. The gist: the app registers actions of public fugures and other actors present in public space to generate dynamic 'lesser evil' lists for the purpose of voter and consumer decision. The desired functionality is similar to the featured Buycott.com application.

If you like the idea standing behind such an app and are willing to contribute, please contact me.
